I will google "jquery tutorial" and look through the top results until I find something accessible to me. I will work through tutorials until I feel comfortable with the basics, constantly trying things to make sure I'm keeping up. I will also take a read throught the jQuery docs.

The JQuery example snippets at w3schools were very helpful for understanding.

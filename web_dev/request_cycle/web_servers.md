1. The key design philosophy behind linux that it is assumed that the user is competent with computers and should be allowed complete control over the operating system. For this reason, the user is given access to more CLI tools than in windows or mac operating systems, and things that may get a beginner into trouble are not hidden from the user.

2. a VPS or virtual private server is a virtual machine (allocated memory running an OS) that is rented out to remote users who are given full access to the OS.
A VPS allows a remote user to set up a server for cheaper than a dedicated physical server would cost. In some circumstances, there may be associated performance costs, however.

3. The Linux security architecture is built on the assumption that programs must be explicitly given access to root directories. If programs are run from the root user account, they have full access to all of the system files, compromising security.

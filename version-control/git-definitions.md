# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is used to simplify projects that require changes to be made to a code base by multiple contributors. It also makes it easier to roll a project back to a previous version if problems are encountered.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is like a copy of a repository that can be used as a rough draft of the changes that you are going to make to a repository. Branches isolate incomplete changes from the master branch. When the code is finished, it can be merged with the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for a project. A good commit message will state clearly and specifically what changes have been made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two people make conflicting changes to the same part of the same file in two different branches of a git repository and subsequently try to merge them. This happens when differences in the code cannot be reconciled and merged.
